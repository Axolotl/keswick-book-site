      </p><p>Bob Crawford could not have had any idea how prominent his house would become: Villa Crawford, built in 1912, served its first 35 years as the private residence of five different owners, then took a 42-year roller coaster ride as a country club with ups and downs of both membership and drama, and since 1993 has been the historic wing of Keswick Hall, a world-class resort that draws visitors from around the world.
      </p><p></p><p>The Story of Keswick Hall is a book that weaves first hand accounts and archival documentation together with more than 150 images and photographs (many never before published) courtesy of current and former club members, staff members, and local residents. In it, residents and visitors have a snapshot into the storied past and exciting new days of this extraordinary property. History, of course, continues to reveal itself, and new stories about former residents entertain audiences frequently.

      <p>Maybe you were there in 1969 when Arthur Ashe played, or in 1992 when Arnold Palmer helped celebrate the opening of the redesigned golf course. Maybe you remember a conversation with B.A. or Knox Turnbull or Donald Stevens. Maybe you ate in the Hunt Room or played on the golf course when it was only nine holes. Maybe the chefs let you in the kitchen and gave you tastes of upcoming dinners or snacks on the side. Maybe you remember the horses grazing in Liz Wheeler’s corral, or the bubble over the tennis courts, or Debbie Slee’s dress shop. Maybe you attended a wedding, a golf tournament, a fall festival or a Sunday afternoon tea dance.</p>
