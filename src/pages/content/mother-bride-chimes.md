One very nice aspect of using Keswick was being able to let of any worry about guests [at my daughter's] wedding … knowing that they were going to experience a special and unique event, be able to be with each other throughout the weekend (Keswick could handle many), and receive some of the best service(and views) that Virginia has to offer.  They were certainly not at a hotel that is the same everywhere in the US (Generica)!  I was also able to relax, be truly present for our friends and relatives, and enjoy the weekend … even though I live just outside of Charlottesville.
