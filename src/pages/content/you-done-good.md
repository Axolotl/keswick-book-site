WOW!!! What a nice book you have created. I haven't had time to read it all, but it is beautiful. You done good. Very good.

I never heard of a steel swimming pool, but that just shows you how much I know. I see you found a master page designer in Drew. Every page is well thought out and pleasant to look at.
 
I have read maybe 20 pages of The Story of Keswick Hall, and hope to read a lot more of it before long. You did well to gather all the old photos and background information.
