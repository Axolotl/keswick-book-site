I remember a bubble over the new swimming pool along with the tennis court (in the winter) when Ralph Law was the coach.  I remember the ice rink also which was put up in certain months right above the elliptical pool towards the main house.  We joined right after Ralph Law was hired, and he brought other known swimmers in besides us.
