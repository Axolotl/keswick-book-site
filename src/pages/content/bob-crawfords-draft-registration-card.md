---

Though Bob Crawford's draft registration card is dutifully filled out at age 40, there is no evidence that he served in the First World War. He identified himself as a self-employed farmer, and named his wife as next of kin. Bob Crawford moved to Baltimore -- alone -- about the same time he registered. A year later he was found dead in his hotel room.
