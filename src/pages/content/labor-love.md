I gave one of the Keswick Hall books to one of my friends who grew up in Keswick and I just received the sweetest THANK YOU note - she said she couldn't put it down and knows alot of the people mentioned in your book - kudos!!! I find it an interesting and exciting read and I don't know a soul :)

Thank you for sharing your "labor of love" with all of us!!!!
