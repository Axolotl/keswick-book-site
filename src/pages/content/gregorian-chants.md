Throughout the Ashley years, every Sunday from 7 a.m. till noon, guests who wandered into the snooker room heard Gregorian chants. This was what B.A. wanted -- it was an absolute, no question (we did it every Sunday), and shows his cultural background. A steamer trunk sat in the snooker room which housed a stereo system, and we (the porters) set up the cd's in the system so the chants would be heard.
