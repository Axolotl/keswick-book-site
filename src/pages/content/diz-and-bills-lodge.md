I am very impressed! What a great book!  Don't know how you found the time for all the interviewing/ research, much less the time to organize it all..I spent much more time than I realized, randomly reading yesterday..I look forward to reading sequentially ... It was fun to see the pictures of the club, and especially of the pool, and mention of the cabanas...I learned that [my aunt and uncle] Diz and Bill's "lodge" was built as a "party house", rather than as a hunting lodge...Also, I didn't remember about the steel construction of the pool...
