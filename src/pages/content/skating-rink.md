In 1969 twelve families entertained twelve students from Argentina, allowing them to live in their homes the month they were in Charlottesville. We tried to introduce them to many local activities. One family, which belonged to the Keswick Country Club, invited those who wanted to ice skate to go one morning. We skated on the steel pool, I think. Those without skates could rent them. When they tired, hot cocoa was served. Then we all returned to our homes.
