Mr. Eways stopped by and was surprised to see the Persian Sultanabad rug that is in the great hall. He recognized it instantly as one that he and George &amp; Linda Davies sold to Knox Turnbull in the mid 1960s when Knox was doing major renovations. Mr. Eways said the beautiful rug was made between 1890 and 1912, and must have been stored in a closet for years and brought out again during the Ashley renovations.
