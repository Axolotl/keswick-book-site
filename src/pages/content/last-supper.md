In 1978, UVA invited a Professor of Ethics to spend a year teaching in the School of Religion. He and his wife were provided a membership at the country club. They invited my husband Herb and me to go to An Oyster Bash. Oysters were in every dish - peas, potatoes, etc. It was delicious! We learned this was the last night a supper would be served at the club. How sad!
